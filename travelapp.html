            <h3>The Concept</h3>
     
     <p>Coffee NI is an app designed to help you find the best coffee spots around Northern Ireland. The app focuses on making it easier for tourists to find coffee hotspots close to their location. Along with an illustrative style and icon set the app provides key information such as opening ours, menu on offer and other retail products.</p>

            <h3>The Process</h3>
     
     <p>Initially I begun researching around minimalist icon design, to home in on a suitable and achievable style for the app. Looking at other apps was a big part of this process too, breaking them down to their core wireframes helped me get an idea of the app layout and ui patterns. The next was pencil to paper, drawing out and refining wireframes for the app along with sketching out minimised illustrations for each of the cafes to be included in the app. Then it was the testing/prototyping phase using Adobe XD, optimising the usability of the app. For the branding of the app I used the same skills and techniques learned from designing my personal brand. </p>

            </div>
        
        
        <div class="img2">
            
             <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
     
     <p>The biggest challenge I had when designing this app was displaying all of the information on each of the cafes without clustering the screen. To combat this issue I then introduced a tab bar, this allowed me to include all of the information necessary for user needs and still keep everything clean.</p>
     
     <p>Another challenge faced was during my process introducing a consistent theme through the branding and each of the webpages without making too busy with colours. This was made difficult by the variation in colours in the cafe illustrations themselves. To solve this I kept the colour usage throughout within the same colour palette of that of the app branding.</p>

             <h3>Final Outcome</h3>
     
     <p>Upon reflection the app achieved what It was aimed for. I learned a-lot from this project in terms of my working process, not to get overly focused on the final look/aesthetic and instead focus first on the content. This project also helped me learn a-lot more about the functionality of creating an app. </p>
