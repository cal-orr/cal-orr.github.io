        <h3>The Concept</h3>
     
<p>An infographic based on snakes, now the 2nd biggest human killer globally. This infographic explores into the statistics behind the alarming truth. With human population on the rise we are getting closer and closer to these deadly killers.</p>

               <h3>The Process</h3>
     
     <p>This project was research, research and more research. Before i could begin designing I had to collate all of the data and break it down, visualising it into graphs and charts. Alongside this I also made a set of minimal snake illustrations, accurate to the species, from this I was also able to create a twisting snake theme throughout the infographic poster.</p>

             <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
     
      <p>One of the prominent obstacles I faced during this project was my unfamiliarity in using software such as Adobe Illustrator. This was why it was crucial for me to begin the process on paper, to reduce any restraints in my creativity. The second obstacle was designing the Monogram. In theory C and O go together well, however I actually found this made it more challenging to come up with something unique in form. I stuck within the boundaries of a circular shape. After many sketches and redesigns I finally got the monogram to a point I am happy with.</p>

            <h3>Final Outcome</h3>
     
     <p>Overall I am happy with the outcome. I learned a-lot during this process. The brand was consistent throughout and had a clear set of guidelines. I plan on returning to this project, updating it and making changes as I develope as a designer. Looking back on this project I had alot of fun. This project opened my eyes to how much is really involved in the process of creating a brand. Even going into the detail of your brand values and tone of voice, every little detail matters.</p>
