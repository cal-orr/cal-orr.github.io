<h3>The Concept</h3>
     
<p>The concept of this project was to create a personal brand to represent me. There would be 3 main aspects to this brand, the monogram, the visual marque and a word-mark. The personal brand is an important stepping stone for me as a young designer, it is how people perceive me and ultimately it is my online identity.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
     
 <p>The process began with research. This entailed looking at well established brands and analysing them, looking at their us of colour palettes and brand extensions. I also looked at brand guidelines to learn about keeping consistancy across the entire brand.  After my research I began brainstorming and sketching out my ideas. I then chose the strongest concepts and further refined them before beginning any digitilisation.</p>

             <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
     
     <p>One of the prominent obstacles I faced during this project was my unfamiliarity in using software such as Adobe Illustrator. This was why it was crucial for me to begin the process on paper, to reduce any restraints in my creativity. The second obstacle was designing the Monogram. In theory C and O go together well, however I actually found this made it more challenging to come up with something unique in form. I stuck within the boundaries of a circular shape. After many sketches and redesigns I finally got the monogram to a point I am happy with.</p>

             <h3>Final Outcome</h3>
     
     <p>Overall I am happy with the outcome. I learned a-lot during this process. The brand was consistent throughout and had a clear set of guidelines. I plan on returning to this project, updating it and making changes as I develope as a designer. Looking back on this project I had alot of fun. This project opened my eyes to how much is really involved in the process of creating a brand. Even going into the detail of your brand values and tone of voice, every little detail matters.</p>
